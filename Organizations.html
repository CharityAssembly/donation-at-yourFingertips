       <h3>Salvation Army</h3>
           <hr class="my-4">
              <h5>Background</h5>
              <p>The Salvation Army was founded in 1865, in the East End of London, by William Booth. 
                Booth was an evangelist who wanted to offer practical help to the poor and destitute as well as preaching the Gospel to them. 
                It was originally called the Christian Mission, but changed its name to the Salvation Army in 1878.  Its ministry is motivated by the love of God.  
                Eliza Shirley pioneered the establishment of The Salvation Army in the United States. After faithfully serving with the Booths in London's East End as part of “The Christian Mission,” a 17-year-old Eliza followed God's call to America.
                82 cents of every dollar donated to The Salvation Army goes toward program services. The average charity spends 75 percent of their budget on programs, while the remaining money goes to cover overhead costs like fundraising, Sandra Miniutti, with Charity Navigator, told NBC News.
              </p>
              <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
              <p>Its mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and to meet human needs in His name without discrimination.</p>

      <h3>American Cancer Society</h3>
          <hr class="my-4">
              <h5>Background</h5>
                <p>The American Cancer Society was founded in 1913 by 10 doctors and 5 laypeople in New York City. 
                  It was called the American Society for the Control of Cancer (ASCC). At that time, a cancer diagnosis meant near-certain death. Rarely mentioned in public, this disease was steeped in fear and denial. 
                  Doctors sometimes did not tell their patients they had cancer, and patients often did not tell their friends and families that they had been diagnosed with it.  
                  The Society’s founders knew they had to raise public awareness about cancer if progress was to be made against this disease. Despite the enormity of their task, 
                  our founders and their colleagues set about writing articles for popular magazines and professional journals; publishing Campaign Notes, a monthly bulletin of cancer information; and recruiting doctors throughout the country to help educate the public.
                </p>
              <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                <P>At the American Cancer Society, we're on a mission to free the world from cancer. 
                  Until we do, we'll be funding and conducting research, sharing expert information, supporting patients, and spreading the word about prevention. 
                  All so you can live longer and better.</P>

        <h3>American National Red Cross</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>
                  <p>
                    Clara Barton and a circle of her acquaintances founded the American Red Cross in Washington, D.C. on May 21, 1881. 
                    Barton first heard of the Swiss-inspired global Red Cross network while visiting Europe following the Civil War. 
                    Returning home, she campaigned for an American Red Cross and for ratification of the Geneva Convention protecting the war-injured, which the United States ratified in 1882. 
                    Barton led the Red Cross for 23 years, during which time we conducted our first domestic and overseas disaster relief efforts, 
                    aided the United States military during the Spanish-American War, and campaigned successfully for the inclusion of peacetime relief work as part of the global Red 
                    Cross network–the so-called “American Amendment” that initially met with some resistance in Europe.
                  </p>
                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>                  
                  <p>The Red Cross, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, 
                    endeavors in its international and national capacity to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. 
                    Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being.

                  It currently has nearly 1.3 million members.  
                  In the aftermath of World War I, disabled veterans in the United States found themselves seriously disadvantaged, with little governmental support.
                  Many of these veterans were blind, deaf, or mentally ill when they returned from the frontlines. An astonishing 204,000 Americans in uniform were wounded during the war. 
                  The idea to form the Disabled American Veterans arose at a Christmas party in 1919 hosted by Cincinnati Superior Court Judge Robert Marx, a U.S. Army Captain and War World I 
                  veteran who had been injured in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in November 1918. Although it had been functional for some months by that time, the Disabled American Veterans of the World War (DAVWW) 
                  was officially created on September 25, 1920, at its first National Caucus, in Hamilton County Memorial Hall in Cincinnati, Ohio.
                  While touring across the U.S. as part of the election campaign of James M. Cox, Judge Marx publicized the new organization, which quickly expanded. 
                  It held its first national convention in Detroit, Michigan on June 27, 1921, at which time Marx was appointed the first national commander. 
                  In 1922, a women's auxiliary organization was founded. The DAVW continued working through the Great Depression to secure the welfare of disabled veterans, 
                  although their efforts were troubled by fundraising challenges and the desire of the public to put the World War behind them. In the midst of these troubled years, 
                  DAVWW was issued a federal charter by Congress, on June 17, 1932.

       <h3>United Service Organizations</h3>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>The United Service Organizations Inc. (USO) is an American nonprofit-charitable corporation that provides live entertainment, such as comedians, actors and musicians, social facilities, and other programs to members of the United States Armed Forces and their families. 
              Since 1941, it has worked in partnership with the Department of War, and later with the Department of Defense (DoD), relying heavily on private contributions and on funds, goods, and services from various corporate and individual donors. Although it is congressionally-chartered, 
              it is not a government agency.  Founded during World War II, the USO sought to be the GI's "home away from home" and began a tradition of entertaining the troops that continues today. Involvement in the USO was one of the many ways in which the nation had come together to support the war effort, 
              with nearly 1.5 million people having volunteered their services in some way. The USO initially disbanded in 1947, but was revived in 1950 for the Korean War, after which it continued, also providing peacetime services. During the Vietnam War, USO social facilities ("USOs") were sometimes located in combat zones.
            </p>
          <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
            <p>The USO is a congressionally chartered, nonprofit organization, and is not a part of the federal government. Since 1941, the USO mission has remained the same: to provide morale, welfare and recreation-type services to service members and their families.</p>

        <h3>American Foundation for Children with AIDS</h3>
           <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>
                 <p>The American Foundation for Children with AIDS (AFCA) is a non-profit organization that helps children in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as their guardians, 
                    who are HIV positive or who have contracted AIDS and lack access to appropriate medical care. 
                    Sub-Saharan Africa has been most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, given that of all new HIV infections in the world, those in sub-Saharan Africa account 
                    for more than two-thirds of that number, as of 2008.  In helping to fight the battle against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, AFCA provides critical antiretroviral 
                    medicine and other related medications, medical equipment and supplies, nutritional supplements, emergency supplies needed by the institutions in AFCA's targeted areas, 
                    as well as critical support for the prevention of HIV/AIDS, which included training of personnel. Currently, AFCA collaborates with twenty-eight partners in the Democratic 
                    Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.  The organization, operating under the name Global Foundation for Children with AIDS until 2005, received its 501(c)(3) status in March 2004. 
                    Its headquarters were originally located in Lawrence, KS, but were moved to Harrisburg, PA, in August 2008. AFCA's first partners were the Pediatric Infectious Disease Clinic at the Mulago Hospital in Kampala, 
                    Uganda; St. Mary's Mission Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya; and the Mombasa Community-Based Health Care and AIDS Relief Program in Mombasa, Kenya. AFCA expanded its partnerships in 2005 to include St. Joseph's Shelter of Hope Center in Voi, Keny
                    later adding St. Mary's Mission Hospital and St. Theresa's Home of Hope in Elementita, Kenya, in 2007. Also in 2007, AFCA began working with a program called Zimbabwe Orphans through Extended Hands (ZOE) in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. 
                    In 2008, AFCA began partnering with the Church of the Ascension in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe and in 2009, AFCA expanded its partnerships by collaborating with Tandala Hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kilembe Mines Hospital and Cooley Clinic in Uganda. 
                    In 2011, AFCA expanded its partnerships to include 16 additional clinics in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2012, AFCA added Mpumudde Clinic and Atutur Hospital in Uganda to its partner list.

                  <p>
                    Dr. Robert A. Hingson grew up with an interest in health and caring for others. 
                    He attended the University of Alabama, receiving the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, and then entered the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, 
                    Georgia where he received a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1938. Following his studies, he pursued a career in the field of anesthesiology.  
                    Dr. Hingson’s innovative efforts led to three monumental inventions and methods that continue to relieve pain and suffering worldwide today. 
                    He invented a portable respirator anesthesia gas machine and resuscitator called the Western Reserve Midget. This machine is highly transportable 
                    and allows for the delivery of a short-term, general anesthetic. He also performed extensive experiments in the use of anesthesia to prevent pain during childbirth. 
                    These efforts won international recognition and led to the invention of the continuous caudal anesthesia techniques. Dr. Hingson is best known in the public health field for his jet injector, 
                    a tool that has enabled efficient, mass, needle-less inoculation worldwide against such diseases as smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, tetanus, leprosy, poliomyelitis, and influenza. 
                    The “peace gun,” as it is known, allows the inoculation of 1,000 persons per hour with several simultaneous vaccines.

                  <p>The 27-year-old Dr. Bill Jackson, a recent medical school graduate, and his wife, Audrey, were expecting their 5th child. 
                     They had just purchased a practice in Long Beach, California, and were ready to settle down after the long journey of medical school when they got an unexpected call. 
                     Care International was in urgent need of a doctor to volunteer in then war-torn Algeria. “This really isn’t a good time,” Dr. Jackson responded, thinking of his soon-to-be child and new practice. 
                     When he hung up the phone, Audrey said something that changed the future of thousands:  Bill immediately called back and took the position in Algeria. The Jacksons had not considered charity work before, 
                     but it soon became a large part of their life. They traveled every other year as a family to provide medical care in dozens of countries. Audrey made friends wherever she went with patients and their families

        <h3>Children's Hunger Fund</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>

                  <p>Children's Hunger Fund (CHF) is a Christian non-profit organization that resources and empowers local churches in 
                     the United States and around the world to meet the needs of their impoverished community members. CHF's mission is to "deliver hope to suffering children by equipping local churches for gospel-centered mercy ministry. 
                     Dave Phillips, founder and president, began the ministry in 1991, working out of his garage with only one employee. They served eight churches composed of 200–300 families. 
                     In response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, CHF increased its food distribution program in South Central Los Angeles. When the 1994 Northridge earthquake struck the San Fernando Valley, 
                     the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asked Children's Hunger Fund to participate in relief efforts.  CHF launched the Care Package program in 1998. 
                     For the first time, food was packed into cardboard boxes designed to assist a family in need. CHF’s desire was to encourage a more relational approach to helping the poor. 
                     Volunteers were trained to take the food to struggling families, visiting them in their own home, and establishing an ongoing, caring relationship through repeated home deliveries. 
                     What was then known as a Care Package is now called a "Food Pak", CHF's relationship-building tool, used to minister to children and families.  
                     In 2004, CHF began a partnership with Africa Renewal Ministries in Uganda, to form the first Mercy Network. A Mercy Network is a collection of like-minded churches that are pursuing gospel-centered Relational Mercy Ministry. 
                     CHF began resourcing churches in Uganda with Food Paks, and financial support to build homes for Bethany Village orphanage. Two years later, CHF expanded its reach by opening its second distribution center, 
                     located just outside of Chicago, IL. In its first year, the Midwest region trained 64 churches and agencies for Relational Mercy Ministry in their communities. However, this office was closed in July 2018.</p>

        <h3>Children's Relief Mission</h3>
          <hr class="my-4">
              <h5>Background</h5>
                                   
                <p>Baxter Loe, a businessman and preacher from Amarillo, TX, went on a mission trip to India in 1970. While there, he met a man named John Abraham. 
                   John explained his country and people were suffering from poverty, and his own family was starving. 
                   Upon hearing John's situation, Baxter promised to provide help, but after returning to the United States, he was swept back into his daily routine. Some time later, Baxter remembered his promise to John and called for information on how to send him money. 
                   The only response he received was: 'John Abraham is dead'. After receiving this news, Baxter began supporting John Abraham's children, but he felt like this was not enough, so he found support for more children in India, Central American, Africa, 
                   and other countries all over the world. In 1971, Baxter founded Christian Relief Fund. 
                   Now, thousands of children across 30 different countries are supported by CRF sponsors.  
                   In 2004, Jones was visiting with some children in the Nyalenda slum in Kisumu, Kenya, where they asked him if he would wear orange everyday, and he agreed. 
                   When he was promoted to CEO, he reinvented the organization by making orange their signature color.
                  [5] The organization uses this color to speak to renewed hope that will never be taken away.

        <h3>Feed the Nations</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>

                  <p>Feeding The Nations is a non-profit 501(c)(3) International Christian humanitarian relief organization with supporting international offices.  
                     It all started on Sunday, December 26, 2004, when an earthquake in the Indian Ocean sparked a deadly tsunami that became one of the worst natural disasters in recorded history. 
                     The tsunami killed over 230,000 people in 14 nations. Seeing the great need and the opportunity to help, FTN was born in February 2005. 
                     Its very first mission was to get vital food and nutrition to those who were affected by the tsunami. A decade later, FTN is still committed to sharing the love of God, 
                     while bringing the abundance of the developed world to those in critical need in the third world. 
                     FTN has reached 75 nations with over $100 million in total goods and services worldwide, including 150 million meals. 
                     FTN has supplied food, vitamins, water purifiers, Bibles, mattresses, toys, blankets, coats, cooking oil, beans, personal care products, financial assistance and more. 
                     All of this has been made possible thanks to God’s guidance, and the partnership and generosity of various organizations and individuals.
                  </p> 

                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                  <p>Since FTN’s first mission in 2005, and through God’s guidance and grace, we have sent 135 million meals to the hungry and hurting around the world. 
                     With the support of countless partners, we have given over $90 million in total goods and services worldwide. 
                     Over 222 containers of rice meals, soup and dried fruit have been sent to nourish the hungry. 
                     In addition, we have supplied vitamins, water purifiers, Bibles, mattresses, toys, blankets, coats, cooking oil, beans, personal care products, financial assistance and more. 
                     The world is hungry. Each nation has its own needs and its own story. Each person we reach with food and the love of Christ matters to us and to God. 
                     If you’d like to get a better understanding of a few of those stories, then choose a nation from the Missions link above and look over a bit of our history, 
                     of how we’ve come alongside people around the world to meet them in their time of need.

        <h3>Gleanings for Hungry</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>

                  <p>Gleanings started producing food in the summer 1982, God was planting seeds for this ministry well before. 
                     In March 1975, Wally Wenge was appointed to YWAM’s International Council. 
                     During the installation ceremony, three YWAM members prophetically prayed the Lord would give Wally a “Joseph” ministry. 
                     God added clarification to the prophecy and a heart for the needy in 1981 when Wally and his wife, Norma, were with Cambodian refugees in Thailand. 
                     Later that year, while spending Christmas with family in California, God revealed to Wally that the tons of California cull fruit thrown away annually could be used as “gleanings for the needy of the world”.
                     During the first summer of 1982, the Wenges and local volunteers were able to process about 15,000 pounds of donated cull fruit using donated equipment in a borrowed raisin dehydration facility in Yettem. 
                     Roughly 1,500 pounds of sun-dried peaches and nectarines produced that first year were used to feed the hungry in Guatemala after a hurricane and flood. Mercy Ships helped transport the dried fruit to Guatemala 
                     and it was distributed by YWAM missionaries. The next six years all of the dried fruit was shipped to Thailand to help feed the Cambodian refugees who had captured the Wenges’ hearts.

        <h3>Global Links</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>

                  <p>The three women who founded Global Links in 1989 made three critical decisions:
                     <p>1.	Focus on recovery of surplus from hospitals, rather than medical manufacturers’ surplus.</p>
                     <p>2.	Establish long-term programs in targeted countries in this hemisphere, in order to have a sustained impact on healthcare.</p>
                     <p>3.	Rely on volunteers to accomplish most of the labor-intensive sorting, preparation and packing of the recovered materials.</p>
                        These principles, which set the organization apart from others with a similar mission, still characterize Global Links.  
                        Focusing on countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Global Links has, over 25 years, developed a unique and productive 
                        partnership with the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), as well as with in-country Ministries 
                        of Health and the medical and administrative leadership of public health systems.  
                        This regional focus has allowed our organization to acquire in-depth knowledge about the public health conditions in the countries we serve, 
                        form collaborative partnerships and develop valuable cultural competence.  
                        As the former Director of PAHO, Dr. Mirta Roses, wrote, “we consider Global Links to be an important partner and ally in our strategic planning efforts in the region.”  
                        Global Links has a worldwide impact through our Suture Donation and our Medical Service Trip programs.  Global Links collects surplus sterile sutures from hospitals across 
                        the US and provides appropriate types and sizes to resource-poor hospitals around the world.  
                        Without sutures - the material used for stitches - surgery is impossible.  
                        Yet in many resource-poor communities, sutures are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.  
                        By sending this one item, Global Links is able to greatly enhance the care a hospital can provide its patients.  
                        The medical service trips we support enable residents of Western Pennsylvania to improve health conditions in communities throughout the world. 
                        In recent years, Global Links has developed partnerships with organizations in the Pittsburgh region that serve resource-poor communities.  
                        From basic first-aid and hygiene supplies for homeless people, to mobility devices for Western Pennsylvania residents, Global Links is improving life and health in our community.
                    </p>

                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                  <p>Global Links is a medical relief and development organization dedicated to supporting health improvement initiatives in resource-poor communities and promoting environmental stewardship in the US healthcare system.</p>

        <h3>Buddhist Global Relief</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>

                  <p>In 2007 the American Buddhist scholar-monk, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, was invited to write an editorial essay for the Buddhist magazine the Lion's Roar (formerly the Buddhadharma Magazine). 
                     In his essay, he called attention to the narrowly inward focus of American Buddhism, which has been pursued to the neglect of the active dimension of Buddhist compassion expressed through programs of social engagement. 
                     Several of Ven. Bodhi's students who read the essay felt a desire to follow up on his suggestions. After a few rounds of discussions, they resolved to form a Buddhist relief organization dedicated to alleviating the suffering 
                     of the poor and disadvantaged in the developing world. At the initial meetings, seeking a point of focus, they decided to direct their relief efforts at the problem of global hunger, especially by supporting local efforts by those in 
                     developing countries to achieve self-sufficiency through improved food productivity. 
                     Contacts were made with leaders and members of other Buddhist communities in the greater New York area, and before long Buddhist Global Relief emerged as an inter-denominational organization comprising people of different Buddhist groups who 
                     share the vision of a Buddhism actively committed to the task of alleviating social and economic suffering.
                  </p> 

                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                  <p>Our mission is to combat chronic hunger and malnutrition. Bearing in mind the Buddha’s statements that “hunger is the worst kind of illness” and “the gift of food is the gift of life,” we sponsor projects that promote hunger relief for poor communities around the world. We pursue our mission by:
                    •	providing direct food aid to people afflicted by hunger and malnutrition
                    •	helping develop better long-term methods of sustainable food production and management appropriate to the cultures and traditions of the beneficiaries
                    •	promoting the education of girls and women, so essential in the struggle against poverty and malnutrition
                    •	giving women an opportunity to start right livelihood projects to support their families.
                      We also seek to raise awareness of global hunger and advocate for an international food system that exemplifies social justice and conduces to ecological sustainability.

        <h3>Hope for Haiti</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>

                  <p>Hope for Haiti is a non-profit organization based in Naples, Florida, USA, founded in 1990 by JoAnne Kuehner. 
                     Hope for Haiti considers education to be the keystone to sustainable development. By supporting, strengthening, and expanding the resources of existing schools, 
                     Hope for Haiti provides children with the tools they need to create their own future. Hope for Haiti works to improve the overall health of its partner communities with the patient at the center of this process. 
                     Hope for Haiti distributes medications and supplies to rural partner facilities throughout the South and provides school-based public health outreach to students and their communities. To provide greater quality 
                     service and educational resources to local communities, Hope for Haiti also supplies Haitian medical professionals with advanced medical training from international specialists. Treatment & follow-up care are 
                     administered at Hope for Haiti's Infirmary, where patients receive low-cost, quality primary care for dental, surgical, wounds, and laboratory testing.  In many Haitian communities, there are huge demands for 
                     school and community infrastructure improvement projects. Hope for Haiti is proud to have helped address many of these issues in several of their partner communities. Along with the support of local and international 
                     partners and donors, Hope for Haiti has been able to engage construction experts to provide children and their families with efficient, safe and beautiful spaces to live, work, learn and play.
                  </p> 

                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                  <p>The mission of the organization is to improve the quality of life for the Haitian people, particularly children, through education, healthcare, water, infrastructure and economy.  
                     In addition, Hope for Haiti has an emergency relief component and has responded to several natural disasters like the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and Hurricane Matthew since its founding.</p>

        <h3>International Childern's Fund</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>
                  <p>The 40-year history of the International Children’s Fund begins with the ministry of Dr. David Bruenning, but it certainly does not end there. 
                     ICF has become an ever-expanding network of caring relationships, formed between African missionary workers and partners worldwide who sustain their humanitarian efforts. 
                     When Dr. Bruenning began his career as a Christian pastor in Wisconsin, U.S.A., he had no idea his ministry would extend around the world. 
                     The scope of his work expanded as he heeded God’s call to prepare local pastors and lay people with evangelism training to share the Gospel. 
                     This soon led to evangelism training overseas, and before long Dr. Bruenning had developed connections with local ministers across Europe, Asia, India, and Africa.</p>

                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                  <p>The International Children's Fund (ICF) has come to the aid of needy children worldwide since 1978. 
                     We have helped distribute life-saving food, clothing, and medicine across the African continent. 
                     We have also supported the construction of orphanages, churches, schools and vocational training centers, drilled water wells to provide safe drinking water, and established agricultural projects. 
                     Practical, direct grassroots action is the main focus of ICF. We channel the Christian concern of Americans into street-level impact in African villages, where logistics often frustrate traditional relief efforts. 
                     The secret ingredient is a trustworthy network of local, native missionary partners, who personally shepherd gifts of food, clothing, medicine, equipment, and funds to the places children need them most.

        <h3>International Relief Teams</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>
                  <p>In 1986, San Diego attorney and real estate broker Barry La Forgia, participated on a mission trip to Peru where he helped construct shelters for impoverished people living in the Amazon Jungle. 
                     He was so moved by the experience and the desperate needs in the world that he returned to San Diego, left his law and real estate practices, and in March of 1988 formed Southwest Medical Teams.</p>
                  <p>The concept of the newly formed organization was to link people in need with teams of volunteers who had the skills (both medical and non-medical) to meet those needs. 
                     By the end of 1988, Southwest Medical Teams had sent volunteer teams to Oaxaca, Mexico to build a healthcare clinic, to the island of Jamaica to provide emergency care for victims of Hurricane Gilbert, 
                     and to Armenia to treat thousands of people injured by one of the largest earthquakes of the century.</p>
                  <p>In 1996 the name was changed to International Relief Teams to more adequately reflect the work of the organization. 
                     Throughout the years, International Relief Teams has responded to disasters and/or conducted programs in the United States, Central and South America, Eastern Europe, Asia, the South Pacific and Africa.</p>
                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                  <p>International Relief Teams alleviates the suffering caused by poverty and disaster -- from the forgotten corners of the world to right here at home.</p>

                  <p>In 1954, the late Dr. J. Raymond Knighton answered a call in his tiny office at the Christian Medical Society in Chicago. 
                     Ray had a reputation for knowing “every medical missionary in the world,” so when a major pharmaceutical company wanted to donate $25,000 in surplus medicines, they knew just who to call.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Ray and his secretary spent three months distributing 11 tons of medicines where they were needed most.
                     Thus, began the Medical Assistance Programs (MAP)--a faith-based nonprofit providing essential medicines for mission clinics and hospitals in developing countries around the world.
                     Since 1954 MAP has served billions of people with medicines and medical supplies through the help of partners, donors, mission hospitals, clinics, and medical mission teams.
                     Since this humble beginning, MAP International has grown to become one of the most trusted charities in the United States. Millions of people with a heart for ‘the least of these’ 
                     have given their time, talent and treasure to MAP to provide hope for those in despair.

                  <p>In the early 1990s, Houston surgeon, Dr. Patricia Brock Howard, and pediatrician colleague, Dr. Margaret Goetz, traveled to El Salvador on a medical mission. 
                     They were distressed by the conditions under which the local healthcare providers had to work.</p>
                  <p>Upon returning to Houston, Drs. Brock Howard and Goetz, along with other concerned individuals, established a recycling program to channel unused medical equipment and supplies (everything from X-ray machines to bandages) 
                     to qualified healthcare providers who desperately needed them. Their efforts culminated with the establishment of Medical Bridges in July 1997.</p>
                  <p>It is estimated that the United States medical community generates nearly $9 billion in surplus product every year simply because the materials have been opened but never used, or the items are outdated by U.S. 
                     standards and are replaced by newer technology. At the same time, countries all over the world urgently need these discarded stockpiles of medical equipment and supplies.</p>

        <h3>Orphan Grain Train</h3>
            <hr class="my-4">
                <h5>Background</h5>
                  <p>In 1992, Rev. Ray S. Wilke, pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in Norfolk, Neb., volunteered with a group of Lutherans who traveled to Latvia and Russia to help with a church mission. 
                     There they met people with “no hope” in desperate need of spiritual, emotional, and humanitarian aid after the breakup of the former Soviet Union. 
                     The Latvians begged Rev. Wilke to help them more after he went home, and he promised he would.</p>

                  <p>Wilke envisioned a train that would travel through America’s midwest, picking up cars of donated grain along the way, until it reached a port from which the grain would be shipped to feed starving orphans in Eastern Europe. 
                     Upon his return to the United States, Wilke contacted Clayton Andrews, president of Andrews Van Lines, a worldwide transportation company, and told his story. Together, they founded Orphan Grain Train. 
                     “He came to me and asked, ‘Do you think something can be done?'” says Andrews. “I said, ‘Yes, I know how we can help those people.’ I never hesitated and it took off from there.” 
                     As it turned out, railroad operating protocol made the original grain train concept impractical, but Orphan Grain Train was born, nonetheless. Within a year Grain Train’s first shipment, a container of clothing and quilts, arrived in Riga, Latvia.</p>

                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                  <p>In loving response to Christ, the Servant, the Orphan Grain Train movement encourages and enables God's people to share personal and material resources in bringing Christ's name and character to needy people both far and near.</p>

                <h5>Background</h5>            
                  <p>In 1987, my dad was in Brazil on a consulting assignment with the country’s president. His interpreter, a medical student, invited my dad to visit the small clinic outside of Rio de Janeiro at which she volunteered. 
                     What he saw moved him to his core. A community without healthcare, doctors without resources and people without hope. </p>

                  <p>Returning home to Denver, he knew he had to help. So, he and my mom began to collect medical supplies to send to Brazil. 
                     Thanks to the generosity of friends, they filled their garage with donations and paid to deliver those life-saving items to the people who needed them the most. 
                     And that was the beginning of Project C.U.R.E.</p>

                <h5>Background</h5>
                  <p>In 1953, a Detroit housewife--Irene M. Auberlin--embarked upon a remarkable mission. 
                     Inspired by the plight of a single war orphan during the height of the Korean War, Mrs. Auberlin mobilized her friends and family to collect food, baby clothing, cribs, and medicines to ship overseas. 
                     Her original goal--to help one small boy--turned into a much larger mission: relieving the pain and suffering of an entire orphanage filled with 400 hurting children. Under Mrs. Auberlin’s careful watch 
                     (and with the assistance of her husband Lester), the mission expanded. World Medical Relief began collecting and distributing recycled medical and dental equipment, medical supplies, and medicines to aid 
                     thousands of sick and poor people around the globe. They were doing “God’s work,” as Mrs. A. would say, by turning the sins of waste into the miracles of mercy.

                  <p>Africa Development Corps (ADC), formerly known as Visions in Action (VIA), was founded by Shaun Skelton, Andre LeCann and Charles Mutisya in 1989. 
                     While lecturing on management at the University of Nairobi during the 1988-89 school year, Shaun discovered that nonprofit organizations in Kenya 
                     had a great need for different types of volunteers; ones who worked in an urban setting, at a computer in an office, designing brochures and writing funding proposals, 
                     as opposed to the more traditional rural field work. There was a need for volunteers in nontraditional sectors of development, such as human rights, democratization and journalism. 
                     For 25 years Africa Development Corps has fulfilled this need by sending volunteers to the developing world to work for grassroots organizations working in these sectors.</p>

                  <p>A group of thoughtful, committed citizens came together in 1971 to create Greenpeace. A handful of determined activists leased a small fishing vessel, 
                     called the Phyllis Cormack, and set sail from Vancouver for Amchitka Island in Alaska. Their mission was to protest U.S. nuclear testing off the coast 
                     of Alaska with a brave act of defiance: to place themselves in harm’s way</p>

                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                  <p>Greenpeace is a global, independent campaigning organization that uses peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global 
                     environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.</p>

                <h5>Background</h5>                                                                                                                 
                  <p>In the years following World War I, America was gripped by the fear that the Communist Revolution that had taken place in Russia would spread to the United States. 
                     As is often the case when fear outweighs rational debate, civil liberties paid the price. In November 1919 and January 1920, in what notoriously became known as the 
                     “Palmer Raids,” Attorney General Mitchell Palmer began rounding up and deporting so-called radicals.</p>

                  <p>Thousands of people were arrested without warrants and without regard to constitutional protections against unlawful search and seizure. Those arrested were brutally treated and held in horrible conditions.
                     In the face of these egregious civil liberties abuses, a small group of people decided to take a stand, and thus was born the American Civil Liberties Union.

        <h3>World Food Programme (WFP)</h3>

                <h5>Background</h5>                                                                                                                                                                     
                   <p>September 1962, northern Iran. An earthquake strikes the area of Boein Zahra. More than 12,000 people die. 
                      Thousands of houses are destroyed. Cataclysmic for its victims, the tremor is also a baptism of fire for the World Food Programme: 
                      the institution has only existed for a matter of months. Even so, it quickly sends survivors 1,500 metric tons of wheat, 270 tons of sugar and 27 tons of tea.
                  </p> 

                  <p>Created (at the behest of US President Dwight Eisenhower) as an experiment to provide food aid through the UN system, WFP is to be reassessed within three years. 
                     As crises multiply, the experiment proves its worth. A typhoon makes landfall in Thailand. Newly independent Algeria must repatriate and feed its war refugees. 
                     In every case, WFP rises to the task. Its mission is emergency aid, but also rehabilitation. A first development programme is launched in 1963 for Nubians in Sudan.</p>

                  <p>That same year, WFP’s first school meals project – in Togo – is approved. The principle of food aid as a central plank of emergency and development aid gains ground. 
                     In 1965, WFP is enshrined as a fully-fledged UN programme: it is to last for “as long as multilateral food aid is found feasible and desirable”.</p>

                <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
                  <p>The United Nations (UN) World Food Programme (WFP) mission is to end global hunger. WFP provides food assistance at the onset of emergencies and to promote economic and social development. 
                     The World Food Programme was founded in 1963 and is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.</p>

                     By the early 1950s, operations had been established in a number of Latin American countries, followed by Africa in the early 1960s. CARE at this time also began 
                     providing medical services as well as supplies to people in war-torn areas. In most places around the world where human relief was required, CARE had workers on the ground. 
                     In recognition of its broadened service offerings and geographic scope, CARE changed its name in 1953 to the Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere.</p>

              <h5>Background</h5> 
                <p>Muslim Aid is a UK based Islamic charity NGO. It was originally run by former senior staff of the Muslim Council of Britain, and is now run by a new board of seven members which took office early 2018 and is chaired by independent management consultant Iftikhar Awan, 
                  a former trustee of Islamic Relief.  It was first established in 1985, in response to the 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia, by 23 organisations based in Britain.  It was initially led by a committee including Cat Stevens and members from the Muslim Council of Britain.  
                  Stevens served as chairman until his resignation in 1996. Suhaib Hasan became the next chairman. Mahmood al-Hassan became executive director in 1993.  From 1995, Iqbal Sacranie was a trustee.  The following year, conflicts in Afghanistan and Palestine and floods 
                  in Bangladesh saw Muslim Aid expand its emergency relief operations. Over the past 25 years Muslim Aid has grown from a small office in London to an international UK NGO, providing relief and development programmes in over 70 countries across the globe.  
                  By 1989 Muslim Aid's operations had expanded considerably and over £1 million of emergency aid had been distributed throughout Africa, Asia and Europe. As the charity grew, the scope of its work expanded. Muslim Aid believes that in order to really help people, 
                  the causes, not just the symptoms of poverty must be addressed. By 1994 long-term development projects accounted for almost 50% of Muslim Aid's relief activity. As well as helping people overcome crisis' Muslim Aid provides skills and resources to assist people to move forward to a better life.  
                  Muslim Aid works closely with the communities to deliver its programmes and remains committed to working in collaboration with all its beneficiaries to ensure that the solutions are not imposed from the outside. All solutions are culturally sensitive, practical and owned by the beneficiaries.</p>

      <h3>East African Children Fund</h3>

              <h5>Background</h5> 
                <p>The East African Children’s Education Fund, is a not-for-profit organization founded by a group of high school students in October 2007.  EACEF is student-staffed and operates as a fully independent 501(c)3 public charity.  EACEF seeks to improve educational environments in East Africa by constructing school buildings and implementing learning programs. 
                  Having raised in excess of $250,000 dollars, EACEF is the largest independent student-run nonprofit organization in the United States.  Originally focused in Central Province, Kenya, EACEF has now expanded into Western Uganda.  In both countries, EACEF engages in programs ranging from the promotion of English-language literacy to the development of inter-community relations. 
                  EACEF strives to create environments conducive to learning in every aspect of its outreach: through implementing the Nafasi Process, infrastructure initiatives such as the construction of fully equipped classrooms, libraries, kitchens, and latrines help to accommodate the everyday necessities of the students. Programs tailored to the needs of the students and teachers alike 
                  were also designed to ensure the efficient use of the new buildings. EACEF instills academic encouragement in communities that face educational hardships and believes that the first step to prosperity is proper schooling.  The Kirimara Project represents the first trial run of the Nafasi Process. Astounding improvements were achieved in both the lives of the students and their 
                  performance in the classroom through the unique combination of infrastructure improvements and enhancement programs.  The Chania Project seeks to replicate the successes achieved at Kilimara under the Nafasi Process. Located in Nyeri, Kenya, the school serves the children of destitute migrant laborers and squatters.
                  The Shalom Project is EACEF’s first venture into Uganda.  The school will serve a population long neglected in the wartorn region of Western Uganda.
                </p>

              <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
              <p>EACEF exists to create and promote educational opportunity for academically gifted, economically disadvantaged children in East Africa.</p>

      <h3>GlobalGiving</h3>
          <hr class="my-4">

              <h5>Background</h5> 
                <p>GlobalGiving is 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in the United States that provides a global crowdfunding platform for grassroots charitable projects.  Since 2002, more than 950,000 donors on GlobalGiving have raised more than $430 million to support more than 24,000 projects in 170 countries.  
                  Before founding GlobalGiving, Mari Kuraishi and Dennis Whittle were heads of strategy and innovation at the World Bank.  While in that post, they created the first-ever Innovation Marketplace for Bank staff in 1998, an internal competition in which Bank employees pitched their own ideas for fighting poverty worldwide. 
                  The winners received grants to develop their ideas.  In 2000, they took the concept and competition to the outside world.  The Development Marketplace enabled any social entrepreneur to compete for Bank funds.  The program was extremely successful — finalists from all over the world gathered in Washington, D.C., and $5 million was awarded to the 44 most innovative projects.  
                  Based on the Marketplaces' success, Mari and Dennis created an Internet-based platform to facilitate a broader range of social and economic investments in developing countries. In October 2000, they left the World Bank and on February 14, 2002, GlobalGiving (formerly DevelopmentSpace) was launched.
                  Major funding for the launch and early stages was provided by the Omidyar Network, the Skoll Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and the Sall Foundation.  GlobalGiving was launched as a collaboration between the GlobalGiving Foundation and ManyFutures, Inc. In December 2008, ManyFutures became a formal subsidiary of the GlobalGiving Foundation, and all operations were placed under direct foundation management.
                  In September 2018, GlobalGiving announced the appointment of Alix Guerrier as Chief Executive Officer.  Mari Kuraishi stepped down as President on November 1, 2018 and joined her co-founder, Dennis Whittle, on the organization’s Board of Directors.
                </p>

              <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
              <p>GlobalGiving is the first and largest global crowdfunding community that connects vetted nonprofits, donors, and companies in nearly every country around the world. Our mission is to transform aid and philanthropy to accelerate community-led change.</p>

      <h3>China Institute</h3>

              <h5>Background</h5> 
                <p>China Institute was founded in 1926 by a group of distinguished American and Chinese educators including John Dewey, Hu Shih, Paul Monroe and Dr. Kuo Ping-wen.  It is the oldest bicultural organization in America devoted exclusively to China.
                   China Institute was founded in 1926 by a group of distinguished American and Chinese educators including John Dewey, Hu Shih, Paul Monroe and Dr. Kuo Ping-wen.  It is the oldest bicultural organization in America devoted exclusively to China.  Paul Zhi Meng (1901–1990) led the China Institute in America nearly forty years (1930–1967). Madeleine Hsu argues he stressed: 
                  Chinese students—seen as a leadership class that eventually shaped the future of modern China—were not only welcomed in the United States, but funded and protected by powerful American and Chinese interests.  Such preferences for elite, educated Chinese, 
                  as opposed to the open discrimination against laborers and petty entrepreneurs of ghettoized Chinatown formations, laid the foundations for post-1965 immigration selection processes that have produced Chinese as model minority subjects in the late twentieth century.  In 1944, the Institute was chartered by the New York State Board of Regents, and defined as a continuing education organization whose purpose was: 
                  To promote education and culture in art, literature, science, history, and other subjects among Chinese and Americans, and to cultivate a mutual understanding between China and the United States and the citizens thereof, by the administration of funds entrusted to the corporation for use in the establishment of scholarships and for other expenses of students studying in the United States ... and for the exchange of information and views between Chinese and Americans.
                </p>

              <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
              <p>China Institute advances a deeper understanding of China through programs in education, culture, art, and business.  China Institute is the go-to resource on China—from ancient art to today’s business landscape and its rapidly shifting culture. 
                Our programs, school, and gallery exhibitions bring to life the depth, complexity and dynamism of China.</p>

      <h3>United Way</h3>
          <hr class="my-4">

              <h5>Background</h5> 
                <p>The organization has roots in Denver, Colorado, where in 1887 Frances Wisebart Jacobs, along with other religious leaders, began the Charity Organization Society, which coordinated services between Jewish and Christian charities and fundraising for 22 agencies.  
                   Many Community Chest organizations, which were founded in the first half of the twentieth century to jointly collect and allocate money, joined the American Association for Community Organizations in 1918. 
                   The first Community Chest was founded in 1913 in Cleveland, Ohio, after the example of the Jewish Federation in Cleveland—which served as an exemplary model for "federated giving". 
                   The number of Community Chest organizations increased from 39 to 353 between 1919 and 1929 and surpassed 1,000 by 1948. In 1948, Walter C. Laidlaw merged the Community Chest and other Detroit charities to form the United Foundation.
                   Walter Laidlaw's work with the United Foundation became the model for united funds nationally and eventually the United Way organization.  
                   In 1928, a Community Chest organization was established in Cape Town, South Africa. (In 2015, continued neglect by United Way Worldwide, including legal and financial scandals, has led to no active United Way presence in the country and completely severed ties with Community Chest). 
                   By 1974, there were enough United Way organizations internationally to demand the kind of support provided by the national organization, United Way of America and United Way International was born (later these organizations were joined together and renamed to United Way Worldwide). 
                   Its staff spoke eight languages, with a Board of Directors from more than seven countries, working with member organizations. Amundsen, Chief Administrative Officer, served as interim president during a yearlong search.
                   By 1963, and after several name changes, the term United Way was adopted, but not everyone chose to use it. 
                   After Walter C. Laidlaw fell ill, William Aramony became CEO of the national governing body known as the United Community Funds and Council of America (UCFCA) and in 1970 the organization was renamed United Way of America (UWA). It moved from New York City to Alexandria, Virginia in 1971.</p>

              <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
              <p>United Way's mission statement states that the organization “improves lives by mobilizing the caring power of communities around the world to advance the common good.”  The ability of the establishment to mobilize and involve people speaks to the trustworthiness of the United Way and its overall reputation.</p>

              <h5>Background</h5> 
                <p>GiveWell is a nonprofit dedicated to finding outstanding giving opportunities and publishing the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give.  
                   Unlike charity evaluators that focus solely on financials, assessing administrative or fundraising costs, we conduct in-depth research aiming to determine how much 
                  good a given program accomplishes (in terms of lives saved, lives improved, etc.) per dollar spent. Rather than try to rate as many charities as possible, 
                  we focus on the few charities that stand out most (by our criteria) in order to find and confidently recommend high-impact giving opportunities (our list of top charities).  
                   GiveWell started as a group of donors, employed full-time in the hedge fund industry, discussing how to accomplish as much good as possible.  We found ourselves fascinated by the research we were conducting, 
                  but also found that it isn't a part-time job, and few public resources exist that can help with it.  We raised startup funding from our former coworkers and left our jobs to start GiveWell. </p>

              <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
              <p>GiveWell's mission is to find outstanding giving opportunities and publish the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give.  GiveWell is focused on finding a small number of outstanding giving opportunities, not on reviewing as many charities — or as many causes — as possible.</p>

                   By the end of the decade, LWR was also sending relief aid to those affected by conflicts in Palestine, Hong Kong, Korea and Bangladesh. 
                   In the 1960s and 1970s, LWR began forming methodologies of working in agriculture and with farming cooperatives to increase rural incomes and food security in the developing world, 
                  eventually changing its articles of incorporation to reflect its work in international development. In 1979, LWR opened it first regional office in Peru.  
                   In the 1980s, famine in Africa made international headlines, especially the plight of people in Ethiopia.  In response, LWR shipped 5,000 tons of wheat to northern Ethiopia and also opened a regional office in West Africa. 
                   For its work in responding to the Ethiopian Civil War and famine, LWR became the first faith-based development agency to receive the Presidential End Hunger award.  In 1999, LWR moved its headquarters from New York City to the newly built Lutheran Center in Baltimore, Maryland.  
                   Since 2000, LWR has increased its emphasis on sustainable agriculture and climate adaptation while continuing to respond to major natural disasters and humanitarian crises around the world.</p>

              <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
              <p>Affirming God's love for all people, we work with Lutherans and partners around the world to end poverty, injustice and human suffering.</p>

              <h5>Background</h5> 
                <p>In 1941, the Red Cross started a national blood donation program to collect blood for U.S. armed forces; by 1945, the service had collected more than 13 million pints of blood.

              <p>Donating blood products is essential to community health and the need for blood products is constant.  As part of our nation’s critical infrastructure, healthy individuals can still donate in areas that have issued shelter in place declarations. 
                 The Red Cross follows the highest standards of safety and infection control, and volunteer donors are the only source of blood for those in need.  There is no known end date in this fight against coronavirus and the Red Cross needs the help of blood 
                and platelet donors and blood drive hosts to maintain a sufficient blood supply for weeks to come.  In times of crisis, the Red Cross is fortunate to witness the best of humanity as people roll up a sleeve to help those in need.</p>
